## Data updates
In this release, we have updated PROSITE patterns, PROSITE profiles and HAMAP to version 2023_05, and updated InterPro entries accordingly.
We also have integrated 245 new signatures from the PROSITE profiles (23), NCBIfam (144), Pfam (7), PANTHER (9), HAMAP (1), CDD (61) databases.

## New features
### New formats for sequence search batch downloads
As you may be aware, it is possible to submit several sequences simultaneously to the InterPro sequence search. When using this feature, the outcomes for all the sequences can be downloaded together. Once the search is finished, the output can be obtained in FASTA, TSV, XML, GFF, and JSON formats for a duration of 7 days through the Group Actions button (Figure 1). Subsequently, the output can be acquired in JSON or TSV formats.
