Those of you with sharp eyes may have noticed some minor changes to the InterPro web site as we have moved to adopt EMBL-EBI's new site guidelines. Although there have been no major changes to the data or to site features, a little stylisic tweaking has taken place, with minor changes to colours, fonts and a slightly more modern logo. All of this foreshadows a more substantial web site redesign that is underway at present, which will substantially change the look of the site. If you would be interested in getting involved in early testing of the new site, or have opinions on features you would like to see, [please drop us a line](mailto:interhelp@ebi.ac.uk) and let us know.
