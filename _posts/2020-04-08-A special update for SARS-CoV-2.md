# InterPro 78.1 - A special update for SARS-CoV-2

As part of the broader scientific response to the current Covid-19 pandemic, InterPro has updated its SARS-CoV-2 relevant entries, and made them available for researchers as an interim update: InterPro 78.1.

## What was done?
Using the most recent SARS-CoV-2 proteome made available by UniProt, we have updated InterPro to ensure that we provide the most comprehensive set of annotations possible for this protein set. To achieve this, we performed an analysis to identify all InterPro entries and existing member database signatures that matched any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The annotations associated with those existing public InterPro entries were checked by our curation team to ensure they were up-to-date in terms of published literature and associated SARS-CoV-2 annotations. Any currently unintegrated member database signatures were assessed for integration to improve our coverage. This resulted in the integration of 10 new signatures into InterPro.

* G3DSA:3.40.220.30 - IPR043478 - NSP3, Mac2 domain
* G3DSA:3.40.220.10, SSF52949 - IPR043472 - Macro domain-like
* G3DSA:3.90.70.90 - IPR043503 - Papain-like, palm and finger domains
* G3DSA:1.10.1840.10 - IPR043477 - Peptidase C30, domain 3
* G3DSA:2.40.10.10 - IPR043504 - Peptidase S1, chymotrypsin-like fold
* CD15239 - IPR043476 - Yro2-like, 7TM domain
* CD18808 - IPR041679 - DNA2/NAM7 helicase-like, AAA domain
* SSF111474 - IPR043473 - Spike glycoprotein S2
* SSF56672 - IPR043502 - DNA/RNA polymerase

The resultant set of relevant InterPro entries can be found via the SARS-CoV-2 proteome page here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/proteome/uniprot/UP000464024/

## Future updates
We are working closely with our member database Pfam, to ensure a timely inclusion of any new or improved signatures generated by them in response to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data release, within InterProScan, and then into InterPro. Thus allowing our users to easily incorporate the most up-to-date Pfam models into their analysis. Will will continue to update you on this as the data becomes available.
