This release includes new features and improvements to the InterPro website. The list of changes is detailed below. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please [contact us](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/interpro).

## Change of InterPro and other resources data license terms
InterPro data was previously available under the EMBL-EBI terms of use. All of the InterPro, Pfam, PRINTS and SFLD downloadable data provided on the InterPro website is now freely available under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.

The InterProScan software is distributed under the open source Apache License.

More information is available under the [About/License](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about/license/) tab of the website menu.

## New functionalities for the 3D structure viewer
### Disable/enable the picture-in-picture functionality of the structure viewer
When scrolling down a page containing a 3D structure viewer (e.g. PDB structure, AlphaFold or RoseTTAFold page), the structure viewer becomes a popup when the viewer is not in the visible part of the page. We have added the option to disable or enable this functionality in the set of options shown below the viewer.

### Split full screen mode
The split full screen mode allows you to see the 3D structure and protein sequence viewer side by side. This feature was previously available for PDB structures and is now also available for Alphafold models.

## Protein sequence viewer tooltip
When looking at the InterPro entries and signatures mapping in the protein sequence viewer or in the entries displayed in the domain architecture and hovering over an item, a tooltip with extra information about the coverage is displayed. We have worked on the tooltip style to take less space on the screen and not hide the main content shown in the viewer.

## Protein families game
We have added a new page providing information about the Protein families game and proteins under [Help/Protein families game](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/help/protein_families_game/) tab of the website menu.

## Set information included in metadata
The set information is now included in the metadata of an entry. So now the website doesn't need an extra request to get this information.

## Fixes
There have been a few releases that the protein's name was missing from the protein page.
The UniProt protein name is now shown next to the protein identifier at the top of the page.

We have standardised the style of the buttons of the PDB structure and AlphaFold viewers.
