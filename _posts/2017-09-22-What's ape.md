The genus Homo is derived from Australopithecus (the well known ape Lucy is an example of Australopithecus afarensis) is at some time after three million years ago. A gene duplication event happened around the time might have provided Lucy and her descendants a way to boost their brainpower. This duplicated gene is known as SRGAP2 (Slit-Robo RhoGTPase-activating protein 2). The ancestral SRGAP2A protein is a RhoGTPase regulator involved in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth [1]. Around 3.4 million years ago, SRGAP2A was duplicated; this created a truncated paralogue, SRGAP2B. Second duplication happened around 2.4 million years ago, the duplication of SRGAP2B created a ‘granddaughter paralogue- SRGAP2C (Figure 2). This paralogue is believed to be an important gene that contributes to the expansion of the neocortex while the transition from Australopithecus to Homo took place [2].

SRGAP2A contains a F-BAR domain, a RhoGAP domain and a SH3 domain. SRGAP2A forms homodimers through its F-BAR domain (Figure 3). SRGAP2A dimers promote spine maturation and limits spine density in the neocortex.

SRGAP2C is a truncated duplicate of SRGAP2A, which lacks the RhoGAP and the SH3 domain, but retain part of the F-BAR domain. The F-BAR domain of SRGAP2C can form heterodimers with SRGAP2A, this prevents SRGAP2A to form homodimers, and consequently antagonise the function of SRGAP2A (Figure 4). From a study conducted in the mouse model, the expression of SRGAP2C helps neurons travel faster to the target areas and increases the density of longer spines [3]. This mechanism plays an important role in brain development and may contribute to the neocortex expansion of the genus Homo [4].

In InterPro, SRGAP2A can be found in both the SRGAP2 family (IPR030252) and the SRGAP1/2/3, SH3 domain (IPR035648) entries. However, SRGAP2B and SRGAP2C can only be found in the SRGAP2 family (IPR030252) entry (Figure 5). This may, at first, looks odd. But from the alignment, we can see the protein sequence similarity among SRGAP2A/B/C at the N terminus and the truncation of SRGAP2B/C at the C terminus, where the RhoGAP domain and the SH3 domain lie (Figure 6). 

In evolution, gene duplication is an important mechanism for acquiring new genes and creating genetic novelty in organisms [5]. It’s not surprising that SRGAP2 is not the only case that gene duplication has created a new functional gene and has great impact on evolution. Another example is the ARHGAP11B gene that arose from the partial duplication of ARHGAP11A after the hominin lineage split from genus Pan. ARHGAP11B has also been linked to the expansion of the human neocortex [2]. 

Due to their high sequence identity, many human gene duplications are difficult to disentangle during genome assembly and hence are still unverified, hence often overlooked. Nevertheless, there might be more genes like SRGAP2C and ARHGAP11B in the human genome to be discovered. For InterPro, these newly identified paralogues will add the complexity to our protein family function and GO (Gene Ontology) term annotation. Regular update our database/entries will be the key to annotate these paralogues.
