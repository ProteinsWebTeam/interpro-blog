## Protein entry page
A protein entry page contains information on a specific protein provided by [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/).

### Isoform identifier in URL
The protein entry page offers the possibility to display the InterPro matches for different isoforms of a protein in the sequence viewer when they exist. The selected isoform is now exposed in the URL (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/reviewed/O00167/?isoform=O00167-2).
Split comparison mode for isoforms in full screen
The protein isoform selected matches in the sequence viewer can be compared to the default protein matches in full screen mode. To do so click on the split icon located next to the isoform selection drop down menu once an isoform has been chosen, as shown in Figure 1.
