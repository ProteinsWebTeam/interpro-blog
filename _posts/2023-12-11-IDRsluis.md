## InterPro and Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
### Structure is more conserved than sequence
As Linus Pauling, a double Nobel laureate (Peace 1962 and Chemistry 1954), stated, "If we want to understand cells, we must know their structure in terms of molecules" [1]. With this purpose in mind, to grasp the physiology of living organisms, we study proteins at the molecular level. To illuminate our path, we rely on the potent light shed by the evolutionary process, as nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution [2].
Throughout the billions of years in the evolutionary history of life on Earth, protein structures have been better preserved than their amino acid sequences [3, 4]. Therefore, the identification of distant evolutionary relationships between proteins is considerably more effective when comparing structures rather than when comparing their sequences [5, 6, 7]. In fact, due to the recent surge in high-quality structural predictions, the identification of new protein domains and the precise determination of their boundaries have been accelerated through the millions of structural models generated by artificial intelligence techniques [8, 9, 10, 11].

## Challenges in analysing disordered proteins and tools for assessment in InterPro
There are instances when protein structures, which are ultimately responsible for the protein functionality, present challenges in their analysis, prediction, or experimental characterisation. A significant proportion of proteins or protein regions exist in a disordered state when considered in isolation, which accounts for approximately one-third of the human proteome [12]. This disordered state can appear as either a lack of a stable structure throughout the entire sequence or as specific regions within the protein, known as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), respectively [13]. In these proteins, comparing the structural form of their monomeric state with other proteins does not enable us to identify structural similarities that would allow us to infer homology.
Using InterPro, we can easily determine whether our protein of interest is an IDP or rich in IDRs [14]. Recently, the DisProt database, a major manually curated repository of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins [15], has been integrated into InterPro. Additionally, in InterPro, we can map the output of MobiDB-lite (a consensus disorder prediction tool) [16] and the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) confidence scores from AlphaFold [17], these scores provide information about structural stability at the residue level, with a pLDDT value below 70 indicating potential lack of stable structure in isolation (cartoons coloured in yellow and red in Figures 1 and 3).

An example of such proteins, rich in IDRs, can be found in the Yap/Taz/FAM181/PERCC1 family in humans (**Figure 1**). Several members of this family have been experimentally described as regulators of transcriptional activity by interacting with TEAD (TEA/ATTS domain) transcription factors, which serve as the main nuclear effectors of the Hippo pathway, crucial in regulating organ size and maintaining tissue homeostasis in animals. The structural similarity among Yap/Taz/FAM181/PERCC1 family members becomes evident only when we examine these structures while they interact with the proteins they specifically bind to, the TEAD transcription factors. However, their recognition as homologues was only achievable through the identification of conserved regions in their amino acid sequences, using classical computational tools for identifying statistically significant sequence similarity based on the comparison of profiles against sequences (HMMER) and profiles against profiles (HHpred) (**Figure 2**) [18].
