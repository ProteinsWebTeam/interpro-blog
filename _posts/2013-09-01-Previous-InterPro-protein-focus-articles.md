## Wilson’s disease and the copper ATPase transporters
### April 2013

In the American TV series House, episode 'The Socratic Method', a mother
seeming to suffer from schizophrenia is admitted to hospital.
Let’s find out how House solves this case and how we can use InterPro to

## Are we really related? The Rad9/Ddc1 family
### November 2012

Protein family classification is often achieved using computerised
multiple protein sequence alignment and structural analysis.
However, it's not always straightforward to define a protein family.
In this article, we will take a look at an example-the Rad9/Ddc1 family.

## Relax and unwind: the RecQ DNA helicase family
### June 2012

When people go on holiday or travel for a conference, fitting all their
clothes, books and a laptop into a small suitcase often presents a
challenge. For eukaryotic cells, packing their lengthy genomic DNA into
their relatively small nucleus presents a similar challenge.

## Collagen: a ubiquitous, unsung protein
### January 2009

Collagen is a long, fibrous structural protein that is usually
associated with cosmetic enhancements, movie star's lips and anti-aging
lotions. Just as one hopes for these movie stars; there is much more to
collagen than what appears on the surface. Collagen is the most abundant
protein in mammals.
