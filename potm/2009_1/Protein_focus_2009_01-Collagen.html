<h2>Collagen: ubiquitous, unsung protein</h2>
<h3>By Elizabeth Jane Kelly</h3>
<p>
    Collagen is a long, fibrous structural protein that is usually associated with cosmetic
    enhancements, movie star’s lips and anti-aging lotions. Just as one
    hopes for these movie stars; there is much more to collagen than what
    appears on the surface. Collagen is the most abundant protein in
    mammals, making up more than a third of the body’s protein. It is
    the major structural glycoprotein of connective tissues and is
    described as the glue that binds an animal together. Even its name
    comes from the Greek root "k&oacute;lla", meaning glue<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
    The collagen superfamily has at least 20 collagen types. These have at least 38 distinct polypeptide chains
    and more than 15 additional proteins that have collagen-like
    domains<sup>2</sup>. The majority of the collagen
    found in the body, however, belongs to the types I, II, III, and IV.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Type-I collagen</strong>
        is the most abundant in the human body<sup>3</sup>, found in skin,
        tendons, vascular tissue, organs and bones. Gram for gram, type I
        collagen is stronger than steel. An example of type-I collagen
        (CO1A1_HUMAN,<a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02452">P02452</a>)
        can be found in the InterPro entry: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR000885">IPR000885</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Type-IIcollagen</strong>
        is the basis for articular cartilage (dense connective tissue) and
        hyaline cartilage (“gristle”). It makes up 50% of all protein in
        cartilage and 85-90% of collagen in articular cartilage. It forms a
        network of fibres and provides tensile strength to the tissue. An
        example of typle-II collagen (CO2A1_HUMAN,
        <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02458">P02458</a>)
        can be found in the InterPro entries: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR008160">IPR008160</a>,
        <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR000885">IPR000885</a>
        and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001007">IPR001007</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Type-III collagen </strong>is
        a fibrous scleroprotein that is often found alongside type-I
        collagen. Scleroprotein is a simple protein found in horny and
        cartilaginous tissues, and in the lens of the eye. It is the main
        component of reticular fibres in bone, cartilage, tendon, bone
        marrow stroma and other connective tissue. It is this type of
        collagen that yields gelatine when it is hydrolysed. Hydrolysed
        collagen (HCP or purified gelatine) is enzymatically or chemically
        processed to make it more digestible. Although its efficacy is
        debated, it is found in nutritional supplements specifically for the
        treatment of bone diseases and sport related injuries. Mutations in
        the genes that regulate the synthesis of type-III collagen result in
        a clinically serious vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome; type IV<sup>4</sup>. This is an autosomal dominant defect
        in the synthesis of type-III collagen that affects about 1 in 100
        000 people. An example of Type III collagen (CO3A1_HUMAN, <a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02461">P02461</a>)
        can be found in the InterPro entries <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR008160">IPR008160</a>,
        <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR000885">IPR000885</a>
        and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001007">IPR001007</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Type-IV collagen </strong>is
        found in the basal lamina. The C terminus domain is not removed
        during post-translational modifications and so the fibres link head
        to head rather than in parallel. This type also lacks the regular
        glycine in every third residue so the helix structure is not tight
        and exact, causing it to form a sheet: the basal lamina.
        Alport syndrome, an inherited genetic disease, is caused by
        mutations in a number of collagen biosynthesis genes. These
        mutations prevent the normal production and assembly of type-IV
        collagen<sup>5</sup>, which in turn affect the basement membrane of
        the kidney, ear and eye. An
        example of type-IV collagen (CO4A3_HUMAN,<a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q01955">Q01955</a>)
        can be found in the InterPro entries: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR008160">IPR008160</a>
        and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001442">IPR001442</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are a range of
    post-translational modifications to collagen, which extend the
    functional range of these proteins. These include hydroxylation of
    prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding into triple-helical
    conformation, proteolytic conversion of procollagen to collagen and
    oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. The
    different forms of collagen produce different structures, and are
    found as the main component of fascia, cartilage, ligaments,
    tendons, bone, teeth and soft keratin. They also give skin strength
    and elasticity. Collagen is present in the cornea and the lens of the
    eye in its crystalline form.
</p>
<p>
    Connective tissue diseases are often the result of defects in the synthesis and
    secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules
    into extracellular fibres. This results in abnormal fibrillogenesis.
    The L-enantiomer of ascorbic acid, vitamin C, acts as an electron
    donor for eight different enzymes, three of which participate in
    collagen hydroxylation. These reactions add hydroxyl groups to
    proline or lysine in the collagen molecule via prolyl hydroxylase and
    lysyl hydroxylase. Hydroxylation allows the collagen molecule to
    assume its triple helix structure, rendering vitamin C essential to
    the development and maintenance of collagen rich tissue such as scar
    tissue, blood vessels and cartilage. Scurvy is the major disease that
    results from a deficiency in vitamin C, made famous by sailors
    deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables on long haul ocean
    navigations. Other major disorders associated with the degradation of
    collagen are Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus<sup>6</sup> and Rheumatoid arthritis,
    both of which are autoimmune diseases.
</p>

<p>
    The medical and paramedical uses of collagen are fairly diverse. Some of the most important uses are for
    the treatment of burns and bone reconstruction as well as dental,
    orthopaedic and surgical treatments. Collagen from porcine or BSE
    free bovine tissue is usually used for such procedures. A number of
    alternatives to collagen can be used as soft tissue replacements,
    including hyaluronic acid and polyacrylamide gel<sup>7,8,9</sup>,
    though the safety of these fillers is questionable. Collagen is also
    used as a main ingredient for many cosmetic products, to which the
    results of an internet search for “collagen” and “lotion”
    together will attest.

    Structure
</h3>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Protein_focus_2009_01-Collagen_html_m2124cdd.png">
</p>
<p>
    Collagen’s triple helical structure, known as the Madras helix, was first
    proposed by G. N. Ramachandran and G. Kartha in 1954. The collagen
    molecule subunit (tropocollagen) is a rod made up of three
    left-handed helices (distinct from the right handed alpha helix). The
    three helices are twisted together into a right-handed coiled coil.
    Collagen is distinguished by the regular arrangement of amino acids
    in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. Glycine
    nearly always occurs at every third residue, proline makes up about
    9% of collagen and hydroxylproline (Hyp) and hydroxylysine are also
    found. These latter two are both the uncommon results of post
    translational modifications. The sequence normally follows the
    pattern Gly-Pro-Y or Gly-X-Hyp, where X and Y may be any of various
    other amino acid residues. Gly-Pro-Hyp occurs particularly frequently
    and this regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only
    a few other fibrous proteins, including silk fibroin (another fibre
    of high tensile strength). Each chain is over 1400 amino acids long.
</p>
<h3>
    Biosynthesis
</h3>
<p>
    Collagen biosynthesis and assembly follow the normal pathway for secreted
    proteins. Glycosylation of procollagen occurs in the rough
    Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Galactose and glucose
    residues are added to hydroxylysine residues, and long
    oligosaccharides are added to certain asparagine residues in the
    C-terminal propeptide. This is a segment, also found at the
    N-terminal, which is found in procollagen molecules but not in mature
    collagen. Specific proline and lysine residues in the middle of the
    chains are also hydroxylated by membrane-bound hydroxylases.
    Intrachain disulfide bonds between the N- and C-terminal propeptide
    sequences align the three chains before the triple helix forms in the
    ER. The central portions of the chains join, from the C to the N
    terminus, to form a triple helix. Fibrils and fibres are formed in
    the extracellular space once the procollagen chains have been
    synthesised.
</p>
<h3>
    Metabolism
</h3>
<p>
    Collagenases (the metalloendopeptidases
    <a class="ext" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchEC&amp;ec=3.4.24">EC 3.4.24</a>;
    e.g. <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR002169">IPR002169</a>)
    are the enzymes that break down the peptide bonds in collagen (Merops
    families <a class="ext" href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/merops.cgi?id=M9">M9</a>
    and <a class="ext" href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/merops.cgi?id=U32">U32</a>).
    Peptidase U32 can be found in InterPro as well, in the entry
    <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001539">IPR001539</a>.
    Peptidase M9 (microbial collagenase) is found in the InterPro entry
    <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR002169">IPR002169</a>.
    They assist in destroying extracellular structures during the
    pathogenesis of bacteria such as those from the genus Clostridium as
    well as Vibrio. Collogenases are exotoxins; an excreted protein that
    causes damage to host cells by destroying them or by disrupting their
    normal metabolism. This enzyme targets the connective tissue in
    muscle cells and other organs and can help facilitate the spread of
    gas gangrene; a deadly form of gangrene caused by the exotoxins of
    anaerobic bacteria.
</p>
<p>
    Six species of metalloendopeptidase acting on native collagen can be
    isolated from the medium of <i><a class="ext" href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1498">Clostridium
    histolyticum</a></i>.
    Despite this, the potential positive medical contributions of
    collagenases have also been investigated. Most notable is the US Food
    and Drug Administration (the FDA) approved product SANTYL for wound
    healing, as well as the use if collagenase for the treatment of
    Dupuytren’s Disease<sup>10</sup>, Peyronie’s Disease<sup>11</sup>
    and the possibility of using it for the treatment of Glaucoma<sup>12</sup>.
